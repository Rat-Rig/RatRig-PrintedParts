# Printed Parts Repository

## Overview
This repository contains STL files pertaining to all existing, as well as obsolete, 3D-printed elements used in our products.

Each design is named with a unique SKU to distinguish it, along with a version number and a date. In the case where a fresh revision becomes necessary (such as rectifying an issue with the part, significant enhancement, or improving the printability), a new part is released with an incremented version number.

In cases where the part undergoes a complete redesign, the old SKU is retired and a new SKU is assigned to the new design.

In all cases, any STL which has been replaced is relocated into a subfolder labeled "deprecated".

## Repository Layout
- Generic parts which are shared across projects are stored either in 'Alignment Tools' or 'Miscellaneous'
- Unique parts for each project are stored in the project subfolder
- Deprecated parts are stored within a 'Deprecated' subfolder
